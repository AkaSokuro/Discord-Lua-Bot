## Want to try bot?
You must have [luvit](https://luvit.io) installed. If you do you have to configure the `config.lua` file.

Change the configs as you like, and TOKEN as your bot's token (do not share with anyone).

Once you done with the configuration you can now run command `luvit Structures/main` on the terminal.
